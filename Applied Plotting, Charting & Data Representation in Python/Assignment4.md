This visualization was concerned with answering the question of how Naples Metropolitan City earnings have changed between 2017 and 2018. I've downloaded the data from the Italian Platform for Open Data and I've filtered out NaN values and also maintained only rows representing the total earnings. I've plotted a bar chart for each type and also a bar chart showing the total earning for each year. As we can see from 2017 and 2018 the Earnings have decreased substantially in each of the 4 TYPES especially for TYPE 3 and 4.
