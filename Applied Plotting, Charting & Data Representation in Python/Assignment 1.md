an image from a tweet of Iván Duque, president of Colombia that describes how his government effectively fought drug traffic and terrorism

### Prompt

Briefly describe the context for the visual by addressing the following questions:

1. What is the source of the visual? (e.g., URL or bibliographic citation)
2. Who is the intended audience (i.e., decoders)? How do you know this?

### Solution

The visual as said in the caption is from a [tweet](https://twitter.com/IvanDuque/status/1297151862295199745?s=20) of Iván Duque , the president of Colombia. I think that the graphic is intended for Colombian people, I know this because it comes from the president of that nation

### Prompt

1. Identify the specific component(s) of the visual that is/are misleading
2. For each part(s) of the visualization that is/are misleading, identify the mechanism that is used: hiding relevant data to highlight what benefits us; displaying too much data to obscure reality; using graphic forms in inappropriate ways (distorting the data)
3.  Explain how the mechanisms are used to mislead

### Solution

The component that is misleading is the bar chart particularly the time range, in the first chart we can see that has been used a time range of 8 years(2010-2018) in the second chart we see a time range of 2years(2018-2020). in my opinion this graph uses **graphic forms in inappropriate way** comparing two graphs of two different time ranges.
